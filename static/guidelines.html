<h2>Choosing Targets</h2>
<a id='target'></a>
First attack should always be your mirror, if your mirror has been defeated you are free to choose your target using the following guidelines in order of importance
<ol>
<li>Obtaining stars; if you can reasonably be expected to get stars then you should
<li>Attack as high up the map as you can; You certainly shouldn't be attacking more than three castles below unless there is not a reasonable chance of obtaining a star higher up the map
<li>Any castle if there is less than four hours remaining in the war and you can obtain multiple stars
</ol>
